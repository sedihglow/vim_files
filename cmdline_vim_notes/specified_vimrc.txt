-- Option: -u <vimrc> --
Use any vimrc specified when instansiating vim.
	vim -u <vimrc> , Use <vimrc> instead of any .vimrc

This caught my eye. Using this i can just make an alias on whatever system i
am on to go to wherever the git repo with the vimrc is on the system. Making
a alias seems low effort for a quickie solution.

instead of alias idea, is there a way to just set it up in general?
- might still be worth doing a script to install the vimrc and paths etc. in
  the repo.
