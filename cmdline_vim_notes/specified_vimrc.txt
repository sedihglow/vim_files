-- Option: -u <vimrc> --
Use any vimrc specified when instansiating vim.
	vim -u <vimrc> , Use <vimrc> instead of any .vimrc

This caught my eye. Using this i can just make an alias on whatever system i
am on to go to wherever the git repo with the vimrc is on the system. Making
a alias seems low effort for a quickie solution.

instead of alias idea, is there a way to just set it up in general?
- might still be worth doing a script to install the vimrc and paths etc. in
  the repo.


--- Starting at last cursor position, option: -c [cmd] ---

Interesting idea to always default to last cursor position regardless if
the session is saved up. (Probably assumes that the viminfo file is set up in
a way so the markers are valid.)

						help *viminfo-file-marks*

Uppercase marks ('A to 'Z) are stored when writing the viminfo file.  The
numbered marks ('0 to '9) are a bit special.  When the viminfo file is written
(when exiting or with the ":wviminfo" command), '0 is set to the current cursor
position and file.  The old '0 is moved to '1, '1 to '2, etc.  This
resembles what happens with the "1 to "9 delete registers.  If the current
cursor position is already present in '0 to '9, it is moved to '0, to avoid
having the same position twice.  The result is that with "'0", you can jump
back to the file and line where you exited Vim.  To do that right away, try
using this command: >

	vim -c "normal '0"

In a csh compatible shell you could make an alias for it: >

	alias lvim vim -c '"'normal "'"0'"'

For a bash-like shell: >

	alias lvim='vim -c "normal '\''0"'

Use the "r" flag in 'viminfo' to specify for which files no marks should be
remembered.
