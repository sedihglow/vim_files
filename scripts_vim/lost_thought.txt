--- First written down log of soon to be a distant, longed for, brain moment.
--- (Dunno if other files will crop up, so just stating this is the OG commit)
Had a lost thought moment, at this commit (whatever one that is).

It was good to. Had a back and forth (not a convo or that kind of back and
forth) for what was going and got near the end of the chain, thought i have
to write it because some reason.

poof.

Figured id at least acknolege my poof.

The sequal with the thought now remembered comming soonâ„¢. -_-;

PS after though -- Not even entirly sure it was - even loosely - vim related,
				   but that was the last thing i remember activly doing.
				   What i was thinking right before the lost thought, well,
				   we can pretend.
