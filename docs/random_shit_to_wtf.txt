I was in options.txt via the help menu.

-------------
What happened

- Hit some shit with the ctrl button while trying to go to a tag.
-*** The screen split and sent me to another place in options.txt.
  - I am not sure the exact location in options.txt but it was not just a
    spit of a file because it was not at the start and it was somewhere else
    than the original location.
- Original location had to do with comment bullshit
-




-------------

.. i forgot what the page was. --;

I hit some shit,


-- ctrl+" --
maybe ctrl+" while over a tag, it jumped me twice when trying to recreate what
happened.
 - it jumped me to the top of the page
   - did it again and it jumped me back to where i was  in options.txt
     - Did not work after that, got an error, the error had something to do
       with jumping to a marker


Basically i dont think it was that

       --- testing with ctrl+"
(I coudt probably just find ctrl+" in the fucking help files.. sighlaughtsadfun)
(p.s. of course theres a typo in sighlaughsadfun)

-
 i was on a line ish 1854 or maybe ish
 it took me to line 1840 at the column where 'comments' begins on that line
-
 pressing it more, unsure if i moved the cursor line but probably did.
	- Pressing ctrl+" x 2 does the sae as ctrl+(x2)"

init - line 1854
goes to visversa - line 1851
-

i am putting this at the bottom becuase this is where i will give up and fucking
look at documentation. Because good shit has it, the best shit ignores it D:
=====

And here it is. ctl+" is not what i did tho for sure

turns out cant find shit off the bat.

-
so AI is a stupid fuck. And even chatgtp3 is better than bard giving me fake
bullshit. anyway,

pressing ctrl+" does shit,
but then i tried to ctrl+z, and it gave the marker error...

ill try to pay attention when recreating it.
E78 Unknown Marker *but probably without caps ;P*
