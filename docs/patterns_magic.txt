                            -- magic --
If a character is taken literally or not depends on the 'magic' option and the
items in the pattern mentioned next.  The 'magic' option should always be set,
but it can be switched off for Vi compatibility.  We mention the effect of
'nomagic' here for completeness, but we recommend against using that.
