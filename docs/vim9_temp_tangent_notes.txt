I randomly am looking at vim9 doc and jotting down bullshit for organization
and stuff later.

Vim Documentation:

If you do it like this, you get an error at compile time that "PluginFunc"
does not exist, even when "g:loaded_plugin" does not exist: >
	def CallPluginFunc()
	  if exists('g:loaded_plugin')
	    PluginFunc()   # Error - function not found
	  endif
	enddef

You can use exists_compiled() to avoid the error, but then the function would
not be called, even when "g:loaded_plugin" is defined later: >
	def CallPluginFunc()
	  if exists_compiled('g:loaded_plugin')
	    PluginFunc()   # Function may never be called
	  endif
	enddef
