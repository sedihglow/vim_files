3. Write the Vim syntax file.  Or download one from the internet.  Then write
   it in your syntax directory.  For example, for the "mine" syntax: >
	:w ~/.vim/syntax/mine.vim

Now you can start using your syntax file manually: >
	:set syntax=mine
You don't have to exit Vim to use this.

If you also want Vim to detect the type of file, see |new-filetype|.

If you are setting up a system with many users and you don't want each user
to add the same syntax file, you can use another directory from 'runtimepath'.

6.  Defining a syntax		|:syn-define|

---- c_autodoc : autodoc.txt ----
- cannot find a help file documentation for it with a quick try

- There appears to be no real information on this file. Did a google search
  and nothing came up right away other than one other person asking about it
  and no one having an answer.

  It says its an embedded parser, used in particular for C comments and
  documentation in the code itself. Could be used for extracting documentation
  from code? There may be plugins that do it.
