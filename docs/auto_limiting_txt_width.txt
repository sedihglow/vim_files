limiting the text width in a more automated way.

- TODO WITH NOTES: can make small adjustments or scripts for particular
  languages, for example make it wrap but if its a string in C
  start the next line under the above's '"' and go to that point automatically
  on the textwidth limit so i dont have to make hte whitespace and line up the
  code neat as manually
  first '"', and the first line with a ' "' and place the wrapped text after
  the second lines auto inserted '"'.
(I added the TODO string late, see what i mean... ", for example")

:set wrap
changed how displayed.  It doesn't change the text buffer, see 'textwidth' for that.



To make scrolling horizontally a bit more useful, try this: >
		:set sidescroll=5
		:set listchars+=precedes:<,extends:>
	See 'sidescroll', 'listchars' and |wrap-off|.
	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the 'diff' option is


The line will be broken in the middle of a word if necessary.  See
'linebreak' to get the break at a word boundary.
