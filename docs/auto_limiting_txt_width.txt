This document contains notes about the commands, settings and options for
limiting the text width in a more automated way.

- TODO WITH NOTES: can make small adjustments or scripts for particular languages, for example
  make it wrap but if its a string in C start the next line below the above's 
  first '"', and the first line with a ' "' and place the wrapped text after
  the second lines auto inserted '"'.
(I added the TODO string late, see what i mean... ", for example")
